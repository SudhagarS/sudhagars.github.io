Hello!

I am Sudhagar. I have been coding ever since I got fascinated by computers. Language Junkie. I obsess over understanding how things work under the hood. 

I live in Chennai. I have worked as software developer at Zoho and Crowdfire before. I also built [Goodshows](https://home.goodshowsapp.com) and [Whileaway](https://www.whileaway.top).

I have created two little gems in Ruby. You can view their code on {% include icon-github.html username="SudhagarS" %}. I am {% include icon-twitter.html username="shotwhat" %} on Twitter.
